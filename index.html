      <p>My name is George Raymond. I am a aspiring developer located in Los Angeles CA. 
          I am currently enrolled in the coding bootcamp at UCLA. My goal is to aquire a postition as a junior developer
          upon completion of this program. In the past I have worked in various industries including sales and contracting. 
          I first got into coding out of curiosity however I soon realized that learning to code is much more obtainable
          than I previously thought. I then realized that it is very possible to make a career out of coding without a
          degree in computer science. I am currently working on building a working knowledge of both front and back end technologies.</p>
